MLX90614
=======

.. class:: MLX90614(i2c, [address])

    The basic class for handling the communication with the sensor.

    The ``i2c`` parameter is an initialized IÂ²C bus, and the optional address
    specifies which sensor to connect to, if you have more than one and have
    changed their addresses with the ``Addr`` pin.

    All temperatures are returned in Celsius.

    .. method:: read_ambient_temp()

        Get the ambient sensor temperature

    .. method:: read_object_temp()

        Get the object temperature from the first or only thermopile

    .. method:: read_object2_temp()

        Get the object temperature the second thermopile, if it exists

    .. property:: dual_zone

        set to ``True`` if this sensor has two thermopiles

    .. property:: ambient_temp

        Equivalent to ``read_ambient_temp()``

    .. property:: object_temp

        Equivalent to ``read_object_temp()``

    .. property:: object2_temp

        Equivalent to ``read_object2_temp()``
